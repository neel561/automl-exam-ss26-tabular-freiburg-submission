# AutoML Exam - SS26 (Tabular Data)

This repository serves as a template for the exam assignment of the AutoML SS26 course at the University of Freiburg.

The aim of this repository is to provide a minimal installable template to help you get set up and running.

## Installation

To install the repository, first create an environment of your choice and activate it. 


**Virtual Environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv automl-tabular-env
source automl-tabular-env/bin/activate
```

**Conda Environment**

Can also use `conda`, left to individual preference.

```bash
conda create -n automl-tabular-env python=3.10
conda activate automl-tabular-env
```

Then install the repository by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

You can test whether the installation was successful by running the following command:
```bash
python -c "import automl"
```

We place no strict restrictions on the Python version or libraries you use, but we recommend using Python 3.10 or higher.

## Code
We provide the following:

* `download-datasets.py`: This script downloads all the datasets (both the practice datasets and the official exam dataset) provided for the exam. All datasets are released from the beginning of the exam.

* `run.py`: A script that loads in a downloaded dataset, trains an _AutoML system_ and then generates predictions for
`X_test`, saving those predictions to a file. For the practice datasets, you will also have access to `y_test` which
is present in the `./data` folder; however, you **will not** have access to `y_test` for the exam dataset.
Instead, you will generate the predictions for `X_test` and submit those to us through GitHub Classroom.

* `./src/automl`: This is a Python package that gets installed via the setup instructions above. It will contain the source code for whatever system you choose to build. We have provided a dummy `AutoML` class to serve as an example.

**You are completely free to modify, install new libraries, make changes and in general do whatever you want with the
code.** The only requirement for the exam will be that you can generate predictions for `X_test` in a `.npy` file that we can then use to give you a test score through GitHub Classroom.


## Data

You can download all datasets (both the practice datasets and the exam dataset) using:
```bash
python download-datasets.py
```

This will by default download the data to the `./data` folder with the following structure:

```bash
./data
├── bike_sharing_demand
│   ├── 1
│   │   ├── X_test.parquet
│   │   ├── X_train.parquet
│   │   ├── y_test.parquet
│   │   └── y_train.parquet
│   ├── 2
│   │   ├── X_test.parquet
│   │   ├── X_train.parquet
│   │   ├── y_test.parquet
│   │   └── y_train.parquet
│   ├── 3
    ...
├── brazilian_houses
│   ├── 1
│   │   ├── X_test.parquet
│   │   ├── X_train.parquet
│   │   ├── y_test.parquet
│   │   └── y_train.parquet
    ...
├── exam_dataset
│   └── 1
│       ├── X_test.parquet
│       ├── X_train.parquet
│       └── y_train.parquet
    ...
```

The fold numbers `1, ..., n` refer to **outer folds**, meaning each can be treated as a separate dataset for training and validation. You can use the `--fold` argument to specify which fold you would like to use. The exam dataset has only one fold.

### Practice datasets:
The following datasets are provided for practice purposes:

* bike_sharing_demand
* brazilian_houses 
* wine_quality
* superconductivity 
* yprop_4_1

## Running an initial test
This will train a dummy AutoML system and generate predictions for `X_test`:
```bash
python run.py --task bike_sharing_demand --seed 42 --output-path preds-42-bsd.npy
```

You are free to modify these files and command line arguments as you see fit.

## Exam

The exam dataset has only one fold. You will need to generate predictions for this fold.
In the exam dataset, `y_test` is intentionally **not provided**.  

You must generate a predictions file named: `predictions.npy`  

- Save this `.npy` file in the `data/exam_dataset/` directory.

Once you push this file to the `test` branch (after Phase II begins), GitHub Actions will automatically detect it, compute the R² score for the exam dataset, and push the results back to your branch.

Running for exam_dataset:
```bash
python run.py --task exam_dataset --seed 42 --output-path data/exam_dataset/predictions.npy
```

## Running auto evaluation for the exam dataset

Please note that auto-evaluation takes place **exclusively on the `test` branch** and will only become active once Phase II begins on **21.07.2026, 00:00**. Any pushes made to the `test` branch before this time will not receive a score. 

Because GitHub Classroom creates unrelated histories for the `main` and `test` branches, you cannot use `git merge main` from the `test` branch directly. There are many ways to move your changes from other branches (e.g., from the `main` branch) to the `test` branch. Here is a simple way:

```bash
# on some_branch (e.g. main) do:
git add data/exam_dataset/predictions.npy
git commit -m "Generated predictions for the exam dataset"
git checkout test
# now you should be in the test branch
git checkout main -- data/exam_dataset/predictions.npy # only copies the data/exam_dataset/predictions.npy to the test branch and stages it, ready to be committed
git status # ensure that your latest `data/exam_dataset/predictions.npy` is staged
git commit -m "Generated predictions for the exam dataset, ready for evaluation"
git push
# wait for some time (few seconds) or monitor the web UI of GitHub to see if the job ran successfully
git pull 
# test scores will be downloaded under `data/exam_dataset/test_out/` if the job ran successfully
```

Feel free to use any other command to move the prediction files from other branches with unrelated histories to the test branch (`rebase`,`merge some_branch_with_unrelated_history --allow-unrelated-histories`, `stash`...), **<span style="color:red">just make sure that there is nothing else inside `data/exam_dataset/` except for `predictions.npy` and the evaluation results that we push</span>**.

A summary of the evaluation workflow:
* To initialize auto-evaluation for the exam dataset, checkout to the `test` branch.
* Make sure you have named the prediction file `predictions.npy` and placed it in the `data/exam_dataset/` directory in this branch.
* After pushing to it, the evaluation script will be automatically triggered.
* The results are also pushed to your repository (don't forget to `git pull`).
* If no new commits are pulled by `git pull`, check the errors in the GitHub Actions tab (red cross inline, last commit message, test branch).

### <span style="color:red">Important: On your repository's `test` branch, you must only commit and push the `predictions.npy` file. Do not commit or push the downloaded `.parquet` dataset files; they must remain strictly on your local machine. The `data/exam_dataset/` directory on your `test` branch should then look like this:</span>

```bash
./data
└── exam_dataset
    ├── predictions.npy
    └── test_out
        └── test_evaluation_output_2026-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss-ms
```

<span style="color:red"> **Note that any edits to the yaml workflow script are prohibited and monitored!** </span>

## Final submission

The following must be submitted by `03.08.2026, 23:59 CET` for a successful project submission and poster participation (held on **11.08.2026 and 12.08.2026**):

#### **1) Poster submission**
Upload your poster as a PDF file named as `final_poster_tabular_<team-name>.pdf`, following the template given [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T55GFGsoon9a4T_oUm4WXOhW8wMEQL3M/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1).

#### **2) Exam dataset predictions**
The final exam dataset predictions should be uploaded in a file `predictions.npy`, with each line containing the predictions for the input in the exact order of `X_test` given.

#### **3) Reproducibility instructions**
TL;DR: Code and instructions to _reproduce_ the above exam dataset predictions.

A `run_instructions.md` file that guides the user through the commands to run the designed AutoML solution on the training set of the *exam dataset*.
This command should return either: (i) a hyperparameter configuration, (ii) a partially trained model based on a hyperparameter configuration, or (iii) a fully trained model (completed within `24 hours` at most).
A second command that, given (i), (ii), or (iii), generates predictions for `X_test` for the *exam dataset*. This will result in your `predictions.npy` file.

#### **4) Team information**
Upload a file `team_info.txt` with the list of matriculation IDs of team members (*NO NAMES*). (E.g.: 1234567, 7654321)

## Tips
* To ensure you and your teammates are all on the same page regarding dependencies, you can modify the
`pyproject.toml` file and add any new dependencies there. This will ensure that everyone's environment is consistent.

* Please feel free to modify the `.gitignore` file to exclude files generated by your experiments, such as models,
predictions, etc. Also, be a friendly teammate and ignore your virtual environment and any additional folders/files
created by your IDE.
